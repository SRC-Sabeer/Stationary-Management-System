# Stationary-Management-System
This project is aimed at developing a tool for tracking the Stationery request for an organization
named HMT Technologies. Normally in any institution the request for the stationery is tracked via an
e-mail or via excels sheets or registers and this leads to tremendous wastage of resources. For
example: - there may be scenarios where the quantity kept in the godown or store of the item may
be more than needed and the supply of few items may be less than needed. This system will thus
help in reducing the wastage at the same time look into generating reports to give a high level view
to the higher management for the benefit of the organization.
